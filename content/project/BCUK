This programme continuity grant is funded by [Blood Cancer UK](https://bloodcancer.org.uk/). 

Tumour cells migrate to protective niches in the body to avoid destruction by conventional therapies. We are modelling this in the laboratory in order to identify the mechanisms tumour cells use to migrate. The aim of this project is to identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent tumour cell migration and promote their destruction.
