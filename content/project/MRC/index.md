Ibrutinib and venetoclax have revolutionised treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). However, they are non-curative and some patients remain refractory or develop resistance. This project has two main aims; A. to develop a simple assay to predict which patients will respond well to these drugs, and which will not, and B. to investigate resistance mechanisms utilised by the tumour cells of non-responsive patients. This will enable us identify novel therapeutic targets for those with more challenging disease.
