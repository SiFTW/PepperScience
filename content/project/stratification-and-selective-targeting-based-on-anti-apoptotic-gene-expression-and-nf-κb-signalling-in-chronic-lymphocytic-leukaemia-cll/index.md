This PhD studentship is funded by a local philanthropist, Paul Stanforth. The project is designed to use NF-kB fingerprinting and link them to the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins to stratify chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The ultimate aim is to identify the best drugs for each individual patient.
