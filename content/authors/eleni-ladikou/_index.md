A microscopy photograph of AML cells (round shiny cells) adhered to stromal cells (elongated adherent cells). AML cells adhere to BM cells in order to protect themselves from destructive drug therapies.  This model is being used to identify mechanisms to release AML cells from the protective BM niche and force them into the circulation where they will be more susceptible to destruction using conventional AML therapies.
