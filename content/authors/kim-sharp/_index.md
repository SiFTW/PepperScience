Kim studied Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the University of Bristol, then joined the Myeloma Molecular Therapy Team at the Institute of Cancer Research where she was involved in the bio-banking of blood and bone marrow samples from national myeloma clinical trials. Kim is now completing her PhD in the Pepper Lab at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School where she is working on targeting leukaemic stem cells in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia using ProTide nucleoside analogues.

Cell cycle analysis before and after FACS sorting AML cells into a CD34+CD38-CLL-1- 'stem-like' sub-population and a CD34+CD38+CLL-1+ bulk tumour sub-population. Cells were treated with CytoPhaseT Violet dye for 90 minutes at 37°C and then acquired on a flow cytometer equipped with a 405 nm (Violet) laser with a 450/45 bandpass filter. Cell cycle distribution was analysed using the FlowJo v10 Dean Jett Fox univariate cell cycle platform. This assay is being used to identify different characteristics in the more ‘stem like’ population in a tumour as these cells are most likely to cause relapse. Once differences have been identified, more targeted therapies can be developed.
