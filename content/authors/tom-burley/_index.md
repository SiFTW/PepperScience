CLL cells were circulated through our novel circulation system lined with HUVEC endothelial cells for 48h. Some CLL cells migrated out of the circulation, through the pseudo-vessels into extravascular space on the other side. This is an electron microscopy photograph of the outside of a pseudo-vessel showing CLL cells that have migrated through. Differences between the CLL cells that migrate and those that donâ€™t are being studied in order to identify mechanisms to prevent tumour cell trafficking and metastasis.
