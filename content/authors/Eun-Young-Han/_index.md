Anna is an Academic Clinical Fellow and incoming haematology registrar at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and Royal Sussex County Hospital. She completed her undergraduate degree in Biology at Boston College before pursuing medicine at Queen’s University Belfast. Her passion for haematology and translational research was cultivated during her two-year position as a research assistant at Boston Children’s Hospital’s Transfusion Laboratory, where she was involved in investigating the bone marrow microenvironment in the context of inflammatory stress and sickle cell disease. Currently, her research focuses on developing novel therapies for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) by targeting the anti-apoptotic proteins using two innovative CDK9 inhibitors. Her project is funded by National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).
