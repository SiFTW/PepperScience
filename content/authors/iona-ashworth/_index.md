Iona studied medicine at Cardiff University and completed a Masters of Medical Research (MRes) at Brighton & Sussex Medical School. She joined the integrated academic training pathway and has successfully completed an Academic Clinical Fellowship in Haematology. Iona is now working as a PhD clinical fellow at Brighton & Sussex Medical School, funded through University Hospitals Sussex. She is investigating the role of non-canonical NF-κB signalling in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). She also works part-time in the Clinical Trials Unit at the Royal Sussex County Hospital.

![Drugs inhibiting NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) significantly inhibited CLL (MEC-1) cell migration against a chemokine gradient in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of CLL cell migration suggests these drugs might be a promising therapeutic in CLL by blocking re-entry of CLL cells to the lymph node microenvironment. ](migration_iona.png)
