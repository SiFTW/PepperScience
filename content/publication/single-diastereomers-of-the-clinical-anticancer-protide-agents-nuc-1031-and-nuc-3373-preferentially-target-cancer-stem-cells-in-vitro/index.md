abstract: A 3'-protected route toward the synthesis of the diastereomers of
  clinically active ProTides, NUC-1031 and NUC-3373, is described. The in vitro
  cytotoxic activities of the individual diastereomers were found to be similar
  to their diastereomeric mixtures. In the KG1a cell line, NUC-1031 and NUC-3373
  have preferential cytotoxic effects on leukemic stem cells (LSCs). These
  effects were not diastereomer-specific and were not observed with the parental
  nucleoside analogues gemcitabine and FUDR, respectively. In addition, NUC-1031
  preferentially targeted LSCs in primary AML samples and cancer stem cells in
  the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. Although the mechanism for this remains
  incompletely resolved, NUC-1031-treated cells showed increased levels of
  triphosphate in both LSC and bulk tumor fractions. As ProTides are not
  dependent on nucleoside transporters, it seems possible that the LSC targeting
  observed with ProTides may be caused, at least in part, by preferential
  accumulation of metabolized nucleos(t)ide analogues.
