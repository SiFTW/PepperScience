abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite B-cell
  receptor-targeted inhibitors revolutionizing treatment. This suggests that
  other signaling molecules are involved in disease escape mechanisms and
  resistance. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a promising candidate that is
  activated by unmethylated cytosine guanine dinucleotide-DNA. Here, we show
  that plasma from patients with CLL contains significantly more unmethylated
  DNA than plasma from healthy control subjects (P < .0001) and that cell-free
  DNA levels correlate with the prognostic markers CD38, β2-microglobulin, and
  lymphocyte doubling time. Furthermore, elevated cell-free DNA was associated
  with shorter time to first treatment (hazard ratio, 4.0; P = .003). We also
  show that TLR9 expression was associated with in vitro CLL cell migration (P <
  .001), and intracellular endosomal TLR9 strongly correlated with aberrant
  surface expression (sTLR9; r = 0.9). In addition, lymph node-derived CLL cells
  exhibited increased sTLR9 (P = .016), and RNA-sequencing of paired sTLR9hi and
  sTLR9lo CLL cells revealed differential transcription of genes involved in TLR
  signaling, adhesion, motility, and inflammation in sTLR9hi cells.
  Mechanistically, a TLR9 agonist, ODN2006, promoted CLL cell migration (P <
  .001) that was mediated by p65 NF-κB and STAT3 transcription factor
  activation. Importantly, autologous plasma induced the same effects, which
  were reversed by a TLR9 antagonist. Furthermore, high TLR9 expression promoted
  engraftment and rapid disease progression in a NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγnull mouse
  xenograft model. Finally, we showed that dual targeting of TLR9 and Bruton's
  tyrosine kinase (BTK) was strongly synergistic (median combination index, 0.2
  at half maximal effective dose), which highlights the distinct role for TLR9
  signaling in CLL and the potential for combined targeting of TLR9 and BTK as a
  more effective treatment strategy in this incurable disease.
