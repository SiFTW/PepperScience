abstract: Combined analyses of the pairs of biomarkers A IGHV mutation status
  and CD49d, B IGHV mutation status and telomere length and C telomere length
  and CD49d as predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) in CLL patients. D
  Shows the overlaid Kaplanâ€“Meier curves for the ARCTIC/ADMIRE cohort, which
  demonstrate that patients with mutated IGHV genes and short telomeres have a
  similar, inferior PFS to the unmutated IGHV subset. Furthermore, patients with
  mutated IGHV genes, long telomeres and low CD49d expression have a
  significantly longer PFS than patients with mutated IGHV genes, long telomeres
  and high CD49d expression. E An additional cohort, derived from the FC-treated
  arm of the UK CLL4 trial, confirmed the findings from the ARCTIC/ADMIRE
  cohort. F Shows a schematic diagram of the propose a risk-adapted approach to
  treatment selection, which would contra-indicate frontline chemoimmunotherapy
  for ~83% of patients.
