abstract: Everyone in the team is looking forward to the arrival of Dr. Kinga Pénzes who will be joining us as a post-doctoral researcher in January 2024. 

Kinga is an experienced Hungarian cancer researcher who is going to work as a post-doc on our Blood Cancer UK-funded project entitled ‘Using NF-kB ‘fingerprints to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities within subsets of B cell malignancies’. 

Kinga is currently house-hunting and is very enthusiastic about joining the research team and working on this project. 

As well as being an excellent researcher, Kinga is a keen baker of ‘healthy cakes’ and the team are very much looking forward to trying these out!
