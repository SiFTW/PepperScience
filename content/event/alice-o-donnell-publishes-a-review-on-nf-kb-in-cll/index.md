title: Alice O-Donnell publishes a review on NF-κB in CLL
abstract: >+
  Dr. Alice O’Donnell (pictured here) joined us for 4 months as an Academic
  Foundation Programme doctor and was a brilliant asset to our team. She had a
  very productive and successful time in the lab and generated some very
  interesting data on the effect of some novel IKKa  inhibitors on Acute Myeloid
  Leukaemia and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) cells.  She also wrote a
  fantastic review entitled ‘NF-κB and the CLL microenvironment’ which was
  published in Frontiers in Oncology.
