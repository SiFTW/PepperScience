Elainaâ€™s project is an exciting collaboration with Professor Helfrid Hochegger who is the head of cell cycle control in the genome damage and stability centre (life sciences, university of sussex). The aim of her project is to study the effect of inhibiting cell cycle in blood cancers by targeting a protein called Greatwall. Having completed 4 months with us, Elaina submitted her findings-to-date as an abstract to the British Society for Haematology. She was invited to present a poster at the annual meeting in Liverpool in April 2024 where it drew a lot of interest. 

Elaina also presented her poster at the Sussex Clinical Academic Conference, July 2024, where she won the best poster prize.
