In this exciting project, Eleni developed a laboratory model of the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) bone marrow, and identified two proteins AML cells use to adhere. By adhering to other cells within the bone marrow, the AML cells protected from destruction by chemotherapy. The main findings of the study are highlighted in our ‘featured papers’ section and the full text can be found here: (doi: 10.3390/cancers17010135).
