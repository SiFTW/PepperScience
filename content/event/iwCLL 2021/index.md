The Pepper team attended the XIX international workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (17-20 September 2021). Andrea Pepper gave a keynote lecture entitled ‘Trafficking of CLL Cells to and from the Microenvironmental Niche’. The data presented was generated by a large collaboration between the Pepper team and our colleagues in Brighton and Sussex University Hospital Trust, the Universities of Birmingham, Liverpool, Cardiff, King’s College London and the German Cancer Centre. The talk contained data generated by two members of the Pepper team; Emma Kennedy (funded by the Medical Research Council) and Tom Burley (funded by the Blood Cancer UK) and that of our close collaborator Dr. Simon Mitchell (Mitchell Lab PI).
