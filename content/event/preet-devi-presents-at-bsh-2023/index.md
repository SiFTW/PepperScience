title: Preet Devi presents at BSH 2023
abstract: Dr. Amarpreet Devi is an Academic Clinical Fellow who joined us for 4
  months/year for 3 years whilst doing an MRES. Preet was studying the effect of
  an array of novel IKKa  inhibitors on the viability of primary CLL cells.
  Having completed 8 months with us Preet submitted her findings-to-date as an
  abstract to the British Society of Haematology. She was invited to present a
  poster at the annual meeting in Birmingham in April 2023 where it drew a lot
  of interest. Preet is pictured here with her poster.
