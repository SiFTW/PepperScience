title: "Dr Emma Taylor-Gallardo graduates"
abstract: "We were delighted that Emma T-G came to spend 4 weeks with us following her final year as a medical student. Emma wanted to get some experience in laboratory cancer research having battled cancer herself as a teenager. She learned an array of laboratory skills and at the SCRC she gave an emotional presentation of her own journey from being a cancer patient to a qualified doctor."

Emma graduated from BSMS in July 2024 achieving distinctions in years 3,4 and 5 OSCEs and an award for the greatest contribution to the community. It was lovely for Chris and Andrea to be part of Emmaâ€™s graduation ceremony and we are looking forward to her coming back to our research labs having been accepted on the Kent Sussex Surrey and Wessex specialised foundation programme as junior doctor.
