abstract: >+
  We are looking for a talented and enthusiastic postdoc to join our team to
  work on a Blood Cancer UK-funded project. The project title is "Using NF-κB
  ‘fingerprints’ to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities within subsets of B
  cell malignancies." The ultimate goal of this interdisciplinary project is to
  exploit computational models to accurately identify the ‘right drug(s) for the
  right patient’ and then test these predictions in the laboratory using
  patient-derived tumour samples. If you are interested in applying for this
  post, feel free to make contact with us directly. All of the information about
  the application process can be found using the link below:
