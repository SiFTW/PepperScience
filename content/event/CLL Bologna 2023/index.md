Chris’s talk was entitled ‘Trafficking of CLL cells to and from the microenvironmental niche’ and started with an overview of some of our historical research and then described some of the exciting new data generated by Emma, Iona and Lauren. As the ability of CLL cells to traffic is essential to their survival, identifying the mechanisms they utilise to do this will enable us to develop novel drug targets.

It was an excellent meeting and an opportunity to discuss CLL research with many of our collaborators including Dimitar Efremov (senior researcher, Trietse, Italy),  Silvia Deaglio (professor and head of research unit, University of Turin)  and Satyan Gohil (consultant haematologist at university college hospital and university college London).
