Clinical fellow Dr Iona Ashworth also had a poster entitled ‘Targeting NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia’.

Both posters generated a huge amount of interest and the whole team came away from the conference with lots of new and exciting ideas.

The team ended the trip with a visit to Harvard University.
